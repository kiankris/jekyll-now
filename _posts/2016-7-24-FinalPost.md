### Overall thoughts on CS373

The class is about to end and overall I found it to be a well thought out course. Dr. Downing is an excellent lecturer with a great amount of experience teaching this course. He hands out plenty of examples and any code that he goes over in class is already available through his github page.He requires that you use several development tools that you would use at an actual job. The class is especially challenging when you have little or no background on the tools that you will use and it will feel hard to keep track of all of those things at once. I found this class to be one of the most usefull CS classes that I have ever taken here at UT and I definitely recommend taking it.

We had daily quizzes which I found to be relatively easy so long as you paid attention to the material from the previous lecture. However it is quite penalizing to miss a quiz as those will not be dropped. 

The first two projects aren't particularly difficult in practice as the main goal was to ensure that you were able, or learned how, to use tools like GitHub, Travis CI, pylint, unit testing, etc. I found this experience invaluable as I hadn't been introduced to any of these things in other classes. The last project, building a static website, was particularly difficult but easily the most useful project I have ever done in my college career. I learned about building and managing the front and back end of a website which is something that I had wanted to do for awhile. Through that project I learned about data scraping, RESTful APIs, SQLAlchemy and Flask.
